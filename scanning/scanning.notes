scanning is the next step after information gathering
we directly exchange packets with the target to ascertain some technical info about their machines/stack

what are we scanning for?
open ports usually
if we can find one machine with one open port it is vulnerable and can be exploited

for example every http server has either port 80 or port 443 open to handle incoming http requests
or for example a company keeps port 5555 open on all of their machines to transfer files internally, etc
maybe the software they use on these open ports is outdated and has a known vulnerability...?
